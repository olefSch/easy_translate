## üèóÔ∏è Example Project where easy-nlp-translate gets used

This [Repo](https://github.com/philipp-mey/nlp_frontend) shows an example project where `easy-nlp-translate` is used to translate video subtitles. It demonstrates how to integrate the library into a project and utilize its features effectively. The project includes a Streamlit frontend which enables users to upload videos in order to generate subtitles. Those subtitles then get translated using `easy-nlp-translate` and then saved as SRT files.
